Broke in less than 1 hour!

Most of this faucet is well designed and built but the sprayer lever is poorly constructed and it broke off in less than one hour of use! The hinge pins on the sprayer lever are made of low quality cast metal that snapped easily. Hard to imagine anyone would design a kitchen product this way-- the sprayer lever is built more like a cheap toy. The main base and water control valve feel well built and of solid construction. It looks great and works great and would have rated it much more highly if the sprayer lever was better constructed. Build would not accept returns on an installed item but Kohler promptly agreed to send out a new sprayer head. We will have to see how long the new one lasts.

Beautiful statement in the kitchen but the wishbone button broke

This faucet was installed about 2 years ago.There are 2 small plastic pins that hold the wishbone -shaped lever onto the faucet head, the lever you push for the fan spray. One of the pins broke. I saw another review with the same issue, and that customer had to replace the head twice. I wish I could buy just the lever and not a $90 faucet head. Also, the soft spray option sprays too widely. It needs a smaller diameter. Every time I try to use it, I get water everywhere. So I don’t use it, but I wish I could for washing vegetables. Also, the handle is now dripping.

Love this Faucet

I’ve had this faucet for four years and I still love it. The powerful pre-wash spray is great. It goes in and out of its holder very well. I will buy this again for my next kitchen.

Kohler is worth it.

I bought a less expensive faucet from a different company. It began to show wear and diminished performance after a year and a half. So I replaced it with a Kohler faucet. It was more expensive, but it is a far better faucet that is made well with the best material and will last and perform well for many years. I knew how good Kohler products were from previous experience and should have known to get a Kohler in the first place. Lesso learned.

Awesome & Great Kohler Cost Svc with Replacement Part

Like many others, the little plastic button that switches the spray setting kept popping off until it was no longer useable. Called Kohler customer service and even though I had the faucet for over a year, they replaced the entire spray head for free with free shipping (a $100 value). I was so impressed by that! I love the spray features of this faucet!

Useless after less than 16 months

This faucet would be great if it weren’t made with cheap plastic mechanisms, two of which have already broken less than 16 months after my kitchen was completed. One is the button that changes to spray and the other changes the spray from regular to mist. Just from regular use, these both started falling off. This week while resnapping a small black piece on for the millionth time, a brittle part of the plastic broke. Even when you snap the larger pieces on, they are unstable and you have to use them carefully. Seems outrageous. Now I have to buy a new faucet and pay a plumber. Super frustrating and a waste of $1000 for parts and labor.

Then, the toggle switch used to move through the spray functions came off rendering the unit useless. I wouldn't under any circumstances purchase this product again and want to warn others not to make the mistake I made.

The faucet is beautiful. It looks very well-made. But they use a cheap plastic on the front lever of it, so as soon as you touch it it breaks. The first time I touched it, it snapped. Thanks Kohler… Way to put quality behind your name.

Yes this faucet is much larger than the faucet it replaced in my kitchen but what a great addition. The quality is there. The water pressure is so much stronger than my original faucet, the different spray options are very useful and the magnetic head release is much better than a pull down mechanism in my opinion. It took me some time to adjust to the noticeable size of this faucet but it’s definitely an updated modern look and I love it. I chose the stainless steel finish which matches my hardware and appliances.

We love this faucet however I'm giving it only 3 stars because the sprayer in the "light shower" mode has a tendency to have random streams of water shooting out in random directions. I have notified Kohler about this and they happily sent me a replacement head. When I first hooked up the new head the light shower mode was working perfect! However, a few hours later a small random stream of water started to shoot out in one direction : ( I guess this will be an ongoing issue. The faucet is on the expensive side to have these problems so soon. Makes me wonder how it will be operating after a few years.

I like the way it looks but the only thing that bothers me is that the top part where the coils are leans to the left a bit. So the faucet looks crooked a bit. I feel like it's an eyesore. It is, however, very powerful and I like that. If it didn't lean like that I would have given it five stars.

Someone suggested if you are shorter it might not work for you. I'm 5'1 and it is perfect for me. The faucet arrived on time, in perfect condition, and is very high quality. It has great design and function.

This faucet is for home use. It has the power and flexibility we need. Easily switches between spray options. I love that the docking arm is magnetic and holds the faucet in place. Form meets function to perfection. The faucet is more powerful than a traditional faucet, but that is one of the reasons to choose a semi-professional kitchen sink faucet; as a result, you may experience some spraying of water onto the counter. It is completely manageable.

One glaring design flaw


I like everything about this faucet, however I'm 6'2" tall..... However, if you are shorter than that, you may run into the same issue my wife and kids run into. The faucet will not pull down out of the arm/magnet holder, you have to pull it out first. You may think this is no issue, but my wife and kids do this every time and the plastic magnet cover comes off (and eventually breaks). I had to order other covers, and they are backordered which shows this is a universal issue. The faucet head should be redesigned so that pulling it straight down of the holder is possible. For a top of the line faucet such as this, it should not have any issues like this. Otherwise, it's great.

Kohler Tournant Pro...Is Fantastic!


From the moment we opened the box we were impressed with this faucet. The faucet is finished in Polished Chrome. It is larger in person that what the photos show. The fit and finish of the Tournant Pro is extremely nice for a faucet in this price range. The design from the single hole base that is gently sculpted to the tall smooth center column leading up to the control handle and swing arm that holds the spray head is very smooth. The spray head is supported by a coil spring that seems to be well balance, the black tube that supplies the water to from the body to the spray head feels smooth and is seems to be some type of synthetic rubber or teflon tubing. The tubing is attached via a stainless steel crimp fitting that is marked NSF 16 The spray head can fully rotate and is firmly held in place at the end of the swing arm by what seems to be a magnet. When cleaning the spray head becomes necessary, Kohler includes a plastic non-maring tool to remove the spray screens. Be careful upon re-assembly as a small stainless steel screen filter is inside the spray head. The magnet is very effective at doing its job yet it allows easy access to the spray head. The single handle control is one of our favorite features as it is easy to find the temperature that is used often as turning the faucet on and off only controls the flow rate (pressure) leaving the temperature at the last used position. The center spray is very soft and columnar as typical. The Berry Soft is extremely useful when cleaning produce as there is no splash out of the sink basin it is a surprisingly soft spray. When more power is needed, we turn up the temp and use the Sweep Spray. The faucet comes with the required hardware to install it through most countertops. The hot and cold supply lines attached at the factory are 21" long and have the standard compression fitting at each line. For those who are curious, this faucet is manufactured in China.

I bought mine slightly more than 1 yr ago. It's the centerpiece of the counter-top. Everybody talks about it. Works great but I would like the sweep spray to have more water pressure. The soft spray is very gentle. The DockNetik never fails and locks it in place.

Professional quality faucet that works well with large sinks


We have been very impressed with this faucet. The finish is absolutely beautiful and the three levels of spay are extremely useful. I thought it might be a little large, but it looks great with our 3 foot farmhouse sink. The pull spray sticks in place well and can easily reach all corners of the sink when cleaning.

Great product, just as expected.... Really like the two settings for sprayer however on tiny spray sprays unevenly and if not careful we will make a mess on the floor or wherever it is pointing to...

We love it, but.....


We love this new faucet and can't believe we waited so long to replace our old more expensive faucet. We did, however encounter a broken "O" ring just one month after installing. Simple to replace, but most people might not know how or what to replace and would have to pay a plumber $150. It took me 1 minute to replace and cost $2.50 for a package of 10 "O" rings. We love it though!
